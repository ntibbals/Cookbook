### Data Flow
- The user first lands on our homepage where they can login or create an account
- If they login, our application checks the user table to determine who they are
- If they create an account, our application will save their information into our user table
- A user can then search for a recipe which will call out to our recipe api
- Our recipe table will then pull information from the recipe ingredients, reviews and instructions tables
- If the user sees a recipe they like, they can then save the recipe which will save the recipe in our saved recipe table
- They can then view their saved recipes will result in the savedRecipe table calling out to the recipe ingredients table, instructions table, reviews table, comments.
- A user editing their saved recipes will result in the same data flow as viewing their saved recipes but simply override the previous recipe
- If a user creates a recipe, the application will add this to the saved recipe which will concurrently add the recipe ingredients, instructions, reviews, and comments which only reside on saved recipes
