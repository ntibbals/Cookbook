- A user can then search for a recipe which will call out to our recipe api
- Our recipe table will then pull information from the recipe ingredients, reviews and instructions tables
- If the user sees a recipe they like, they can then save a reference recipe to the SaveRecipe table.
- They can then view their saved recipes will call out to the API and return their saved recipes via ID. 
- A user can create a comment, saving it to the Comment table which is connected to the SavedRecipes table.
